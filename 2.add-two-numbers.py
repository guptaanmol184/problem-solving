# Testcase Example:  '[2,4,3]\n[5,6,4]'
#
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
# integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes
# contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked
# list.
# 
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
# number 0 itself.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,0,8]
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
# Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading
# zeros.
#
