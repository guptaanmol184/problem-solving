# Testcase Example:  '[7,1,5,3,6,4]'
#
# You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock
# on the i^th day.
# 
# You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock
# and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
# 
# Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you
# cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit =
# 6-1 = 5.
# Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you
# must buy before you sell.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit =
# 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
# 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start

# Brute force
# T: O(n^2) | S: O(1)

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i + 1 , len(prices)):
                profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
                if profit > max_profit:
                    max_profit = profit
        
        return max_profit

            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            
            if price - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price
