#
# On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.
# Note that:
# 
# 
# The north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.
# The south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.
# The east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.
# The west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.
# 
# 
# The robot can receive one of three instructions:
# 
# 
# "G": go straight 1 unit.
# "L": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).
# "R": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).
# 
# 
# The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them
# forever.
# 
# Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the
# robot never leaves the circle.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
# Output: true
# Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
# "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
# "G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
# "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.
# "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.
# "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.
# "G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.
# Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1)
# --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).
# Based on that, we return true.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: instructions = "GG"
# Output: false
# Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
# "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
# "G": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.
# Repeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does
# not go into cycles.
# Based on that, we return false.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: instructions = "GL"
# Output: true
# Explanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.
# "G": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.
# "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.
# "G": move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.
# "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.
# "G": move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.
# "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.
# "G": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.
# "L": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.
# Repeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1)
# --> (-1, 1) --> (-1, 0) --> (0, 0).
# Based on that, we return true.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= instructions.length <= 100
# instructions[i] is 'G', 'L' or, 'R'.
